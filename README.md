Vamos conhecer um pouco sobre esse labirinto !!



## Projeto do Labirinto

A nossa ideia era criar um labirinto de um supermercado, onde deveriamos pegar todos os produtos andando pelo mapa, usamos alguns comandos e fizemos na plataforma replit em javascript, alguns comandos usados foram:

- Replace e Replaceall
- var
- console.log
- function
- for
- else
- while
Esses são alguns exemplos de comandos que foram usados



## Comandos para instalar as dependencias 

``` npm install  ```
``` node index.js```


Esses dois são os essencias que devem ser utilizados
